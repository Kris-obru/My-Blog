{"id":"1","title":"Brentwood","date":"11/10/2023","content":"<p>I always come to brentwood to work, and it pays really well to doordash here. Even better that I have an electric car that i can literally charge for free. I'm really glad that i have doordash because I really hate working traditional jobs that are strict on scheduling. Of course I am working one right now which isnt too bad because I can do my homework there.</p><h4>11/11/23</h4><p>Just spent the first night of work in my car. Yesterday there wasnt much business so i just was coding this website and messing around with making a minecraft server on google cloud. It was really fun doing that again. I used to make those all of the time and doing it now really is enjoyable again. After so many years i havent really expressed myself in all of the ways that i've wanted to. I've sort of just given up on it. Between Tessa, my mom, and school, its just not been convenient to do anything else but focus on securing my future. But now I'm finding out that there really isn't a point in having a future if i'm not happy with it.</p>","tags":["Work","Growth","Peace","Self Love","Expression"]}
