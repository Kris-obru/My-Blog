{"id":"2","title":"Friends","date":"11/11/2023","content":"<p>I've been doing some thinking about my social life. I've never really made attempts to make friends before, genuinely. I've only ever fallen into friendships that I'm okay with, and still even then don't feel like i contribute much or express myself in the ways that I want to. I don't know why I feel so unmotivated when it comes to talking to people, and when I do start talking to people, I feel overwhelmed for some reason. I really want to make friends who are like minded and are into the same things as me, I just don't know how to think, feel, or act. I don't want to go through college barely meeting people. I just dont know why I feel this way. It has been really hard with my family situation (seperating from parents due to abusive situation), and not being able to have time to myself for the past couple of years, so that could be it. Anyways, being here in Brentwood and spending time to myself definitely is refreshing. Tech is weirdly overwhelming for some reason.</p><p>This is such a weird time in my life. I've gone from thinking I have a good grip on life to my entire world shifting into something completely different. On top of that I don't even know who I am, which has made it so much harder. And while having ego death was definitely a learning experience, having a sense of self is important right now, with the world crashing down on me and all.</p>","tags":["Introspective","Social life"]}
